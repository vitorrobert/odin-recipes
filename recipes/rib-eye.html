    <h2>Descrição:</h2>
    <p> This is a great ginger-soy marinade for steak. It's also wonderful for beef stir-fry.    </p>
    <h2>Ingredientes:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup soy sauce</li>
        <li>¼ cup real maple syrup</li>
        <li>6 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon grated fresh ginger</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon mustard powder</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon sesame oil</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon hot pepper sauce</li>
        <li>½ cup beer</li>
        <li>4 (10 ounce) beef rib-eye steaks</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine soy sauce, maple syrup, garlic, ginger, mustard powder, sesame oil, and hot pepper sauce in a medium mixing bowl; mix well to blend. Add beer and stir lightly to mix.</li>
        <li>Prepare steaks by scoring any fatty outside areas on steak with a knife (this prevents the steaks from curling when grilling). Place steaks in a casserole dish and pour marinade over. Using a fork, punch holes in steaks so that the marinade penetrates into the meat. Turn steaks over and repeat punching holes.</li>
        <li>Cover with clear wrap or foil and let marinate in the refrigerator for 1 hour to overnight.</li>
        <li>Prepare and preheat a grill to high heat. Place steaks directly on the grill and sear one side for about 15 seconds. Turn steaks over and cook for about 5 minutes, then turn over and cook for another 5 minutes for medium-rare, depending on thickness. Test for doneness by cutting into the middle of the steak.</li>
    </ol>
